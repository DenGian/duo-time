## The Mission
It's time to fool around a little! You will be assigned a partner to be working with, starting with HTML and CSS. First you both will make a page about eachother with only HTML and CSS. In the must have features you'll find exactly what things you have to include.

Of course, you might not be sure what you should fill in for this person, this is where you take a guess. The fun part comes when you show them your finished HTML / CSS page. Now, it's time for them to correct and enhance your page using Javascript!
